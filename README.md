# Project-3-AQI
To use interactive data visualization techniques to see the changing Air quality across the world

The Data for the air pollution can be called in real time using an API. The coordinates for the cities are generated reading the HTML and these are then used to call the API.

The three visualizations created for this project are:
1. Interactive Markers based on the amount of air pollution in a given city
2. Interactive Scatter plot showing how the amount of pollution changes with varying factors such as temperature, humidity, windspeed and precipitation
3. Interactive bar graph showing the different factors of the environment across all the 200+ cities of the world
